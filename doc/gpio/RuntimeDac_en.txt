DAC Runtime
===========

Description
-----------

   :scale: 40 %

This block can be used to measure the runtime of several subsystems or blocks of a model or to determine the runtime of different tasks in a multitasking model. Only one controller pin with a digital to analog converter peripheral and a scope are necessary.

To measure the runtime of blocks and/or subsystem each has to contain the *DAC Runtime* block with a different *DAC Value*.

Two modes are possible:

- Each time the execution of a subsystem starts, the DAC is set to the configered value. The correct execution order has to be choosen by block priorities as shown in example 2.

- Each time the execution of a subsystem starts, the actual DAC value is stored and the DAC is set to the new one. After finishing the execution, the old DAC value is restored. 

.. attention::
  Not all pins can be used for DAC output so check the documentation of the used MCU.

Data Type Support
-----------------

This block has no input or output ports.

Parameters and Dialog Box

Port Name/Pin Number
....................
specify the mcu pin. This block supports the naming schema: 'P' + letter 'A', 'B', 'C', ... + '_' + number '0', '1', ... '15', e.g. PA_0.

Mode
....
specify the mode of setting DAC values: 
- set the DAC to the configured DAC value 
- store current value, set the new one at the beginning and set back the stored value at the end of submodel execution.

DAC Value
.........
Value can between 0.0 and 1.0, i.e. 0V and 3.3V in most cases.

Sample Time
...........
specifies the time interval between samples. To inherit the sample time, set this parameter to -1.

.. note::
  If the system is idle and none of the models code is executed the DAC Value is 0. So don't use 0 as the DAC Value for your code.

Example
-------
The first example uses the set/reset modus. The runtime of each model level is depicted in the scope screendump. With the scope measurement features, the runtime of each submodel can be estimated.

The second example uses the set modus. The execution order has to be set with the block priorities as can be seen in the model. The execution start of individual blocks can be measured without the usage of submodels as in the above example.
