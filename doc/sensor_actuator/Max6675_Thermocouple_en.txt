   :scale: 50 %

This block reads the temperature measurement of a cold-junction-compensated K-thermocouple-to-digital converter MAX6675 in [째C]. Minimal temperature is 0째C and maximum temperature is 1023.75째C with a resolution of
0.25째C. 
A measurement value of -1 indicates an open thermocouple input.

..note::
	Maximum conversion time is stated as 0.22s in the data sheet. Since pulling CS low stops any ongoing conversion, it must kept high for the conversion time to guarantee a new measurement.

Data Type Support
-----------------

The block's output value is of data type single.
