I2C Configuration
=================

Description
-----------

This block sets up the I2C connection on the mbed board. 

You must have one of these blocks in any model that ues I2C blocks.

   :scale: 50 %

This block configures a I2C bus peripheral as master using the selected data (SDA) and clock (SCL) pins. The bus clock frequency can be configured.

When the model uses multiple I2C busses, for each one an own *I2C Config* block is necessary.

I2C Port
........

specifies an internal used I2C port number. It is used to generate unique instance names when more I2C busses are used in the same model and to tie config, read and write blocks together.


Bus frequency
.............

Configures the I2C bus clock frequency. 

Port Name/Pin Number (SDA)
..........................

Selects the data pin of the I2C peripheral.

Port Name/Pin Number (SCL)
..........................

Selects the clock pin of the I2C peripheral.

Example
-------

In the example data read from a PCF8574 at address 0x40 is bitmasked. Bits 0 and 1 are written to LED1 and LED2. 

The user button is written to bit 3. Unused bits and both input bits has to be set to 1 (please see the datasheet). The result is written back to the PCF8574.

Code Generation
---------------

Instance names of mbed classes are created by concatenating model name (, submodelnames) and block name (\ **<Model Name>**\ _(**<Subblock Name>**\ _...)\ **<Block Name>**\ \ **<I2C Port>**\ ). Space and minus characters are substituted by underscore ('_') characters.

Global parts
............

creates a global instance

.. code-block:: c++

  I2C <instance name>(P<Port Name SDA>_<Pin Number SDA>, P<Port Name SCL>_<Pin Number SCL>);

Initialization Function
.......................

and one line in void **<Model Name>**\ _initialize(void) function

.. code-block:: c++

  <instance name>.frequency(<Bus frequency>);

in \ **<Model Name>**\ .cpp.
