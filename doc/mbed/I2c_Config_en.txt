I2C Configuration
=================

This block sets up the I2C connection on the mbed board. 


Library

/I2C

Description

   :scale: 50 %

This block configures a I2C bus peripheral as master on a mbed target MCU depending on the selected data and clock pin. In addition the bus clock frequency can be configured.
Since this block internally uses the mbed I2C class to configure the peripheral, the user must select matching SDA and SCL pins as described in the boards user manual.
If the MCU acts as master for multiple I2C busses, each one must have it's own *I2C Config* block.

.. attention::	
	If pins are configured which cannot be mapped to the same I2C peripheral **NO** error will show up at compile time, but the I2C bus won't work.

Parameters and Dialog Box
-------------------------

I2C Port
........

Selects an identifier for the bus that should correspond in the device's configuration which are connected to this particular bus.

Bus frequency
.............

Configures the I2C bus clock frequency. 

SDA Port and Pin
................

Selects the data pin of the I2C peripheral.

SCL Port and Pin
................

Selects the clock pin of the I2C peripheral.

.. note::
	All pins have to be of the same I2C peripheral otherwise the I2C bus won't work.
