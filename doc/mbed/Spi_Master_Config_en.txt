========================

This block sets up the SPI connection on the mbed board.

Description

   :scale: 50 %

This block configures an SPI peripheral depending on the data and clock pins selected. In addition the clock frequency of the bus can be configured. 
Internally the mbed SPI class is used to set up the SPI peripheral, so the user must get the matching pins off of the boards user manual. 

If more than one SPI bus is needed each one needs it's own *SPI Master Config* block.

.. attention::
	If pins are configured which cannot be mapped to the same SPI peripheral **NO** error will show up at compile time, but the SPI bus won't work.

Data Type Support
-----------------

This block has no input or output ports.

Parameters and Dialog Box

Bus frequency
.............

Sets the clock frequency of the SPI bus.

MOSI Port and Pin
.................

Selects the Master In Slave Out pin of the SPI peripheral.

MISO Port and Pin
.................

Selects the Master Out Slave In pin of the SPI peripheral.

SCK Port and Pin
