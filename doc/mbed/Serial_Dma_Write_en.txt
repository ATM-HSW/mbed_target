Serial DMA Write
================

Sends data via UART communication in non-blocking DMA mode.

Description

   :scale: 40 %

This block uses Serial/UART hardware peripheral to send data in non-blocking mode. When the block's code is called the data at the input port are copied into a buffer which is then used by the DMA for transmission.
The number of data to send is provided either by the dimension of the input data port or through a second input port which makes it possible to send less data then the data port vector contains.

For configuration a *Serial DMA Config* block is needed in the model which has matching *Serial Port* configuration value.

Data Type Support
-----------------

The data input port only supports 1-D vectors of uint8 values.
The optional *number of data* port expects a uint32 value.

Parameters and Dialog Box

Serial Port
...........

Selects the hardware UART peripheral of an STM32 MCU. The port number are related to the actual USART/UART numbers referred to the datasheet of the used MCU.

Enable datasize port
....................

Provides a second input port through which the number of bytes to be send can be configured during program execution.

.. note::
	The number of data have to be less then or equal the length of the input data port.
