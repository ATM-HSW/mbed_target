Serial DMA Config
=================

Configuration of serial (UART) communication peripheral with non-blocking DMA data transfer.


Library
-------

Targets/STM/DISCO_F407VG

Description

   :scale: 40 %

This block configures one of the hardware UART peripherals for use with DMA memory to peripheral transfer. The use of DMA transfer makes non-blocking serial communication possible.

Data Type Support
-----------------

This block has no input or output ports.

Parameters and Dialog Box
-------------------------

Serial Port
...........

Selects the hardware UART peripheral of an STM32 MCU. The port number are related to the actual USART/UART numbers referred to the data sheet of the used MCU.

Port Name
.........

Selects the GPIO port name for the transmit and the receive pin.

Pin Number
..........

Selects the GPIO pin number for the transmit and the receive pin.

.. attention::
	The transmit and receive pin have to match the selected *Serial Port* in order to function correctly. In case of a mismatched configuration the model will be build and compile without errors and serial communication does not work.
	
Baud Rate
.........

Speed of data transmission in bits/s. 

common values are: 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, 115200 but higher baudrates are also possible

Maximum possible value depends on the used MCU and selected UART peripheral.
