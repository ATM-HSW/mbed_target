MCP3428 Analog Input
====================

Reads the analog input voltage from the specified channel of an MCP3428 analog to digital converter.


Library
-------

/I2C

   :scale: 50 %

This block reads the conversion result of the analog input voltage of one channel of the MCP3428 analog to digital converter. The voltage measured is the differential voltage between a channels positive 
and negative input, so for single ended input mode one has to connect the negativ channel input to ground.
The different resolutions that can be configured result in different conversion rates. 
Since the internal reference voltage is 2.048V the input voltage of an channel must not exceed +/- 2.048V including the configured gain value. 

Data Type Support
-----------------

The block's output data type depends on the configured mode parameter and can be:

*	raw |srarr| int16
*   voltage |srarr| single
*   relative |srarr| single

The error output data type is boolean.

Parameters and Dialog Box

I2C Port
........

Selects the identifier of the I2C peripheral which is configured by an *I2C Config* block.

Device Address
..............

Bus address of the used MCP3428 device.

Enable error output port
........................

Enables an error output port with return values:

*	"0" if no error occurred 
*	"1" if there was an error during communication


Channel Number
..............

Selects the input channel of the MCP3428 device which should be measured.

Mode
....

Selects the output data type and range

*	raw |srarr| -2^n ... 2^n-1 (with n = resolution - 1)
*	voltage |srarr| -2.048V ... +2.048V
*	relative |srarr| -1 ... 1

Resolution
..........

Selects the digital resolution.

PGA Gain
........

Selects the programmable gain amplifier to amplify the input signal.

.. note::
	The input voltage must not be greater than 2.048V/gain.
