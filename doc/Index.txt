Welcome to Mbed Target documentation!
===========================================

Simulink and Embedded Coder generates C and C++ from Simulink models, Stateflow charts and MATLAB functions. With Mbed Target the generated code is built on top of Mbed OS and executed as a real time application on Mbed compatible microcontroller boards. Mbed Target is an addition to Simulink and Embedded coder. It needs MATLAB versions 2017b. Newer versions may work but are not fully tested. Older version can not be used.

Introduction gives an overview about Mbed Target other other similar targets. The different behaviour is show with short examples. In a raw overview the internal working of Mbed Target is given.

Installation describes the installation of Mbed Target and Getting Started gives two complete examples how to create, build and run a model.

Chapter 4 and the following document the blocks of Mbed Target.
