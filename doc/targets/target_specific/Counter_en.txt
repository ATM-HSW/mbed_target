This block configures a hardware timer peripheral of an STM32 MCU to be clocked by an external input signal. For clock input each timer has two trigger input (TIx) 
sources which are mapped to the timers input channels *TIMx_CH1* and *TIMx_CH2*. So to use this block for counting external events the correct GPIO Port and Pin has to be chosen
and also the matching TIx of the selected *TIMERx* peripheral according to the data sheet of the used MCU.

It is possible to count on rising, falling and both edges of the signal at the input pin. 

The timer's counter register is automatically reset at the configured *Max counter value* parameter or at a nonzero input value at the reset input.
The block can be configured to generate a hardware interrupt at counter overflow to execute a function call subsystem.

.. warning::
	The timer can only be clocked by one input and the can not be used for any other purpose even if there are unused channels provided (e.g. CH3/4).
	Configuring another block using the same timer peripheral could override some or all of the timer's control registers and lead to unexpected behavior.

Data Type Support
-----------------

The block's *reset* input port expects a *uint8* data type which is either zero for normal upcounting or none zero for a reset of the counter register.

The *cnt* output port outputs the actual counter value as an *uint32* data type. 

The *int* output port is a simulink function call output which can be connected to a function call subsystem.

Parameters and Dialog Box
-------------------------

Timer
.....

Number of the actual timer peripheral of the STM32 MCU, e.g. chosing *1* configures *TIMER1* in external counter mode.

Input channel
.............

Choses either trigger input *TI1* or *TI2* as the clock source and configures the edge on which the timer is counting.

Input Port
..........

Selection of the GPIO port where the configured trigger input is mapped to.

Input Pin
.........

Selection of the GPIO pin number where the configured trigger input is mapped to.

Input Pull type
...............

Configures the input mode for the selected MCU pin, possible values are:

* PullNone:		no pull up or pull down resistors are configured for the input pins
* PullUp:		internal pull up resistors are configured for both input pins
* PullDown:		internal pull down resistors are configured for both input pins

Max counter value
.................

Sets the maximum value the counter register can hold before an overflow occours.

.. note::
	The maximum possible value is 2^16-1 since the timers have a 16bit counter register, except *Timer2* it is a 32 bit type.

Interrupt setting
.................

Configures the output ports of the counter block as follows:
* no interrupt generation:	no hardware interrupt is generated at counter overflow, the actual counter value can be read at the *cnt* output
* interrupt + cnt output:	a hardware interrupt is generated at counter overflow and executes the code of the connected function call subsystem in it's ISR, the actual counter value can be read at the *cnt* output
* only interrupt:		a hardware interrupt is generated at counter overflow and executes the code of the connected function call subsystem in it's ISR, the counter value is not provided

Enable reset input
..................

Enables the reset input port of the block to reset the counter register at any time
