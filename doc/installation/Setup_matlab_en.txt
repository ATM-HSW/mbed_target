Matlab Setup
============

The mbed_target folder can be copied somewhere into the directory tree. But it is recommendable to use a path as close as possible to the root. The usage of document or desktop folder may not work in some cases. Windows has a restriction in the maximum command line length and the Mbed Target build process could exceed this length in certain circumstances. As a second requirement \ **the folder name \ *mbed_target*\  must not be changed**\  and has to be unique in the folder hierarchy.

The root directory of the mbed_target folder contains an m-file: \ *setup_mbed_target.m*\ . This files has to be run once before using mbed_target. It adds several folders to the Matlab path and checks/installs necessary tools and libraries in the following sequence:

1. Checking the folder mbed_target\\blocks\\mex if it contains compiled s-functions. If the mexw64 files are missing the setup tries to compile the c-sources. In this case an external c-compiler is necessary. Please see the documentation of the Matlab command \ *mex*\ .

2. Checking the existence of Python. Please be aware that version 2.7 is necessary. The mbed build system is currently not compatible with Python 3! Because the Python package installer pip is used, a Python version newer than 2.7.9 is necessary or pip has to be installed manually. The version 2.7.13 is recommended for the included version Mbed OS.

3. When the Python check was ok then the Mbed OS requirements are installed. This can also be done manually with \ *pip install -r requirements.txt*\  in the mbed_target\\targets\\mbed-os folder.

4. When the Python check was ok then a list of Mbed OS 5 compatible targets is displayed. This can also be done manually with \ *python tools\\project.py -S targets*\  in the mbed_target\\targets\\mbed-os folder.

5. The last check is the verification of the mbed_target installation path. Only the name is checked and not the path length. Strange compiler or linker errors later on when generating a Simulink model can be an indication of a too long installation path.

The output in the Matlab command window should be checked after the execution of \ *setup_mbed_target.m*\  if an error happened or a version number does not meets the requirements.
