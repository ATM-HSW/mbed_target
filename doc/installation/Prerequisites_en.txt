Installation prerequisites
==========================

The Mbed Target needs some tools to work properly:

Python
------

Mbed Target uses the internal mbed tools, a collection of Python scripts. 

Please install version 2.7.13 of Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2713/ 

A newer 2.7.x version may be possible but is not yet tested.

\ **It is not compatible with Python 3!**\ 

During the installation it is necessary to choose the option \ **Add python.exe to Path**\  as shoown in the following figure

   :scale: 70 %

That can also be done later through adding the installation and script folders to the path environment variable. Please see the procedure in the next chapter.

To check the correct installation please call:

.. code-block:: bash

  E:\git\mbed_target\doc>where python
  C:\Python27\python.exe
  
  E:\git\mbed_target\doc>python -V
  Python 2.7.13


GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain and GNU ARM build tools
--------------------------------------------------

The code generation and building process uses the gcc_arm toolchain. Because the currently included Mbed OS version 5.7.7 is tested with GCC 6 (6-2017-q2-update) this version is used.
Some additional tools (make, mkdir, rm) are necessary during the building process.
All tools are integrated into Mbed Target, any additional installations are not necessary.


Further necessary tools: mbed-ls and several Python libraries
-------------------------------------------------------------

They are installed automatically through a call of the \ **setup_MbedTarget.m**\  m-file.

During this setup, beside setting the Matlab environment, the Python installation is checked and the additional Python tools and libraries are installed.
