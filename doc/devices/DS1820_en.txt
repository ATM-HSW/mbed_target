One Wire Bus
............

Selects the One Wire bus which is configured by a *One Wire Config* block. 

Device ID

This parameter contains the 48 bit unique device ID of the sensor to ensure each block addresses the same sensor even if devices are added or removed from the bus.
If only one DS1820 type sensor is connected this parameter could be left empty.

.. note::
	To examine the ID of a particular sensor the example project *oneWireSearchRom_example* could be used.
