Serial Configuration USB (Debugger)
===================================

Description
-----------

This blocks sets up a serial connection on the mbed board. You must put at least one of these blocks into any model that ues the Serial Write or Serial Read blocks.

To use several UARTS at the mbed board, you can put several Serial Config blocks with different Serial Port numbers into the model. Each Serial Port number creates one instance of the mbed Serial class. The read and write blocks sending/receiving over the specific UART have to use the same Serial Port number.

Set the baud rate to match the device that you are communicating with. Standard rates include:300, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 14400, 19200, 28800, 38400, 57600, or 115200.

Serial Configuration and Serial Configuration USB blocks are identical. Where the non USB variant configures the RX/TX pins the USB variant uses the predefined RX and TX pins which are connected to STLink, DAP Link, JLink, ...

Serial Port
...........
specifies an internal used serial port number. It is used to generate unique instance names when more UARTs are used in the same model and to tie config, read and write blocks together.

Baud Rate
.........
specifies the UART baud rate.

Example
-------

see read/write byte :ref:`example_UART_write`.


Code Generation
---------------
Instance names of mbed classes are created by concatenating model name (, submodelnames), block name and Serial Port number (\ **<Model Name>**\ _(**<Subblock Name>**\ _...)\ **<Block Name>**\ \ **<Serial Port>**\ ). Space and minus characters are substituted by underscore ('_') characters.

Global parts
............

creates a global instance

.. code-block:: c++

  Serial <instance name>(USBTX, USBRX);

Initialization Function
.......................

and a line in void **<Model Name>**\ _initialize(void) function

.. code-block:: c++

  <instance name>.baud(<Baud Rate>);

in \ **<Model Name>**\ .cpp.
