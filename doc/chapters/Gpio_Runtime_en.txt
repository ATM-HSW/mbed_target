   :scale: 40 %

This block generates square wave signal at a GPIO pin to measure computational time of a model or subsystem. Therefor the block sets an output pin to high value at the very beging of the susystem's/model's 
code an resets the pin to low at the very end. So the duration of the high pulse is a measurement of the time needed to execute the code of the system the block is placed in.


Data Type Support
-----------------

This block has no input or output ports.
